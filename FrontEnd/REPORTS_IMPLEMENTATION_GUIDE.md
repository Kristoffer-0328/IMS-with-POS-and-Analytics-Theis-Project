# 🚀 Reports Implementation Guide

## What I've Done for You

### ✅ **Complete Enhancements:**

#### **1. Reports & Logs Page Structure**

## 📊 How Each Report Works

### **1. Inventory Turnover Report** *(Already Functional)*

**What it shows:**
- How fast products sell
- Monthly turnover trends
- Product-specific performance
- AI-powered analysis and recommendations

**Data it uses:**
- POS sales transactions
- Product inventory values
- Historical sales data

**Performance Metrics:**
- 3+ turnover = EXCELLENT (selling fast)
- 2-3 = GOOD
- 1-2 = MODERATE (room for improvement)
- <1 = NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (slow moving)

---

### **2. Stock Movement History** *(Functional with Example Data)*

**What it shows:**
- All stock increases (receiving, restocking, found items)
- All stock decreases (sales, releases, shrinkage)
- Daily movement trends
- Movement type breakdown

**Data sources it should use:**
```javascript
// IN movements:
- receiving_logs collection
- restocking_requests (approved)
- pos_transactions (returns)

// OUT movements:
- pos_transactions (sales)
- release_logs (factory/project releases)
- inventory_adjustments (shrinkage)
```

**Current State:**
- Uses example/dummy data
- All UI components ready
- Charts and visualizations working
- **Need to connect:** Real Firebase data

---

### **3. Shrinkage & Adjustments** *(NEW - Example Data)*

**What it tracks:**
```javascript
{
  date: Date,
  productName: String,
  quantity: Number,  // Negative for losses, positive for found items
  reason: 'damaged' | 'expired' | 'theft' | 'error' | 'found' | 'other',
  notes: String,
  value: Number,  // Quantity × Unit Price
  unitPrice: Number
}
```

**Real-world use cases:**

1. **Damaged Item:**
   ```
   Product: Cement bags
   Quantity: 3
   Reason: Damaged
   Notes: "Torn bags during delivery"
   Value: ₱780
   ```

2. **Found During Count:**
   ```
   Product: PVC Pipes
   Quantity: -2 (negative = adding back)
   Reason: Found
   Notes: "Discovered in back storage"
   Value: -₱1,560 (reduces loss)
   ```

3. **Theft:**
   ```
   Product: Power Tools
   Quantity: 1
   Reason: Theft
   Notes: "Missing after inventory count"
   Value: ₱2,500
   ```

**Current State:**
- ✅ Full UI implemented
- ✅ Example data showing all features
- ✅ Calculations working
- **Need to add:** Database collection to store real data

## 🔧 Next Steps to Make Reports Fully Functional

### **Priority 1: Stock Movement - Connect Real Data**

Create a service to fetch actual movements:

```javascript
// In StockMovementReport.jsx, replace dummy data with:

const fetchRealMovements = async () => {
  const movements = [];
  
  // 1. Get POS Sales (OUT)
  const salesQuery = query(
    collection(db, 'pos_transactions'),
    where('createdAt', '>=', startDate),
    where('createdAt', '<=', endDate)
  );
  const salesSnap = await getDocs(salesQuery);
  salesSnap.forEach(doc => {
    const data = doc.data();
    data.items.forEach(item => {
      movements.push({
        date: data.createdAt.toDate(),
        type: 'OUT',
        reason: 'POS Sale',
        product: item.productName,
        quantity: item.quantity,
        value: item.subtotal
      });
    });
  });
  
  // 2. Get Receiving (IN)
  const receivingQuery = query(
    collection(db, 'receiving_logs'),
    where('createdAt', '>=', startDate),
    where('createdAt', '<=', endDate)
  );
  // ... similar pattern
  
  // 3. Get Releases (OUT)
  const releaseQuery = query(
    collection(db, 'release_logs'),
    where('createdAt', '>=', startDate),
    where('createdAt', '<=', endDate)
  );
  // ... similar pattern
  
  return movements;
};
```

### **Priority 2: Shrinkage - Create Database Collection**

Create a new collection for tracking shrinkage:

```javascript
// Collection: inventory_adjustments
{
  id: auto-generated,
  date: Timestamp,
  productId: String,
  productName: String,
  variantId: String (optional),
  quantity: Number,  // Positive = loss, Negative = found
  reason: String,  // 'damaged', 'expired', 'theft', 'error', 'found', 'other'
  notes: String,
  unitPrice: Number,
  totalValue: Number,
  adjustedBy: String,  // User ID
  approvedBy: String (optional),
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

**Where to record shrinkage:**

1. **Manual Adjustment Form** (NEW - needs to be created):
   ```
   Location: Inventory > Products > Actions > "Record Adjustment"
   
   Fields:
   - Product selection
   - Quantity (with +/- toggle)
   - Reason dropdown
   - Notes textarea
   - Photo upload (optional)
   - Submit button
   ```

2. **During Physical Inventory Count**:
   - Compare system quantity vs actual count
   - Auto-generate adjustment for differences
   - Require reason selection

3. **During Receiving**:
   - If damaged goods found
   - Button: "Report Damaged Items"

### **Priority 3: Enhance All Reports**

Add these features across all reports:

1. **Export Functionality:**
   ```javascript
   // PDF Export
   const exportToPDF = () => {
     const doc = new jsPDF();
     // Add report content
     doc.save(`report-${Date.now()}.pdf`);
   };
   
   // Excel Export
   const exportToExcel = () => {
     // Use xlsx library
     const ws = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(data);
     const wb = XLSX.utils.book_new();
     XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(wb, ws, "Report");
     XLSX.writeFile(wb, `report-${Date.now()}.xlsx`);
   };
   ```

2. **Email Reports:**
   - Schedule daily/weekly/monthly reports
   - Auto-email to management
   - Use Firebase Functions + SendGrid/Nodemailer

3. **Alerts & Notifications:**
   ```javascript
   // In Shrinkage Report
   if (shrinkageRate > 4) {
     sendAlert({
       type: 'high_shrinkage',
       message: `Shrinkage rate (${shrinkageRate}%) exceeds threshold`,
       recipients: ['manager@email.com']
     });
   }
   ```

## 📝 How to Use the Reports

### **For Daily Operations:**

1. **Morning Routine:**
   - Check Stock Movement for yesterday's activity
   - Review any shrinkage entries
   - Verify POS sales match inventory

2. **Weekly Review:**
   - Run Inventory Turnover report
   - Identify slow-moving items
   - Plan promotions or markdowns

3. **Monthly Close:**
   - Generate all three reports
   - Calculate total shrinkage percentage
   - Present to management
   - Adjust inventory policies

### **Decision Making Examples:**

**Scenario 1: High Shrinkage on Cement**
```
Shrinkage Report shows:
- Portland Cement: 15 bags damaged this month
- Total value: ₱3,900
- All marked as "damaged during handling"

Actions:
→ Train staff on proper handling
→ Review storage conditions
→ Consider different supplier packaging
→ Add protective pallets
```

**Scenario 2: Low Turnover on Paint**
```
Turnover Report shows:
- White Paint: 0.5x turnover (very slow)
- ₱25,000 stock sitting idle
- Last sale: 3 weeks ago

Actions:
→ Run promotion: "Buy 2 Get 1 Free"
→ Reduce reorder quantity
→ Consider seasonal pattern
→ Bundle with other products
```

**Scenario 3: Stock Movement Spike**
```
Stock Movement shows:
- PVC Pipes: 200 pcs sold (normal: 50)
- All to single customer
- Project purchase

Actions:
→ Follow up for repeat business
→ Ensure adequate restock
→ Offer bulk discount for next order
→ Market to similar contractors
```
