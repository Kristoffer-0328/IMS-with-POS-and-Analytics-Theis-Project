# POS Multi-Location Allocation System

## Overview
The POS system now supports automatic multi-location allocation for products stored across multiple warehouse cells. This allows efficient order fulfillment when a single location doesn't have enough stock.

## How It Works

### Scenario Example
**Order:** 50 pieces of plywood (10 x 20)  
**Cell Capacity:** 24 pieces per cell  
**Solution:** System auto-allocates from 3 cells:
- Cell 1: 24 pieces (full cell)
- Cell 2: 24 pieces (full cell)  
- Cell 3: 2 pieces (remaining)

Total: 48 + 2 = 50 pieces âœ…

## User Flow

### 1. **Quick Select - Single Location** (When one location has enough stock)
   - User clicks plus button on product
   - Modal shows locations with sufficient stock highlighted in green
   - Click location â†’ Product added to cart immediately
   - âœ… **Fast path for simple orders**

### 2. **Visual Map - Multiple Locations** (When need to combine stock)
   - User clicks plus button on product
   - Modal shows "Visual Map" option for each storage unit
   - Click storage unit â†’ ShelfViewModal opens with warehouse layout
   - **Auto-Allocation:**
     - Click empty cells where product exists
     - System automatically calculates quantity based on cell capacity
     - First cells filled to capacity (e.g., 24 pcs)
     - Last cell gets remaining quantity (e.g., 2 pcs)
   - Visual indicators show:
     - Total Quantity Needed
     - Allocated Quantity
     - Remaining Quantity
   - Click "Confirm Selection" â†’ All allocations added to cart
   - âœ… **Intelligent path for complex orders**

## Features

### Visual Warehouse Map
- **Interactive Layout:** Click cells to select locations
- **Color Coding:**
  - ðŸŸ¦ Blue = Selected cell with allocated quantity
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green = Product exists at this location (highlighted)
  - âšª White = Empty cell available for selection
  - ðŸ”´ Red = Occupied by other products
- **Smart Selection:**
  - Click selected cell again to deselect
  - Auto-calculates quantity per cell based on capacity
  - Prevents over-allocation

### Auto-Allocation Logic
```javascript
// Example: Order 50 pcs, Cell capacity 24 pcs
Click Cell 1 â†’ Allocates 24 pcs (min(remaining=50, capacity=24))
Click Cell 2 â†’ Allocates 24 pcs (min(remaining=26, capacity=24))
Click Cell 3 â†’ Allocates 2 pcs  (min(remaining=2, capacity=24))
Total = 50 pcs âœ…
```

### Cart Items
Each allocation creates a separate cart item:
```json
{
  "name": "plywood (10 x 20)",
  "qty": 24,
  "storageLocation": "Unit 02",
  "shelfName": "Lumber & Wood Products",
  "rowName": "Row 1",
  "columnIndex": 1,
  "fullLocation": "Unit 02 - Lumber & Wood Products - Row 1 - Column 1",
  "isMultiLocationAllocation": true
}
```

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Faster Order Processing:** Visual map makes it easy to find and select multiple locations
2. **Accurate Allocation:** Auto-calculation prevents errors
3. **Clear Overview:** See exactly where stock is being pulled from
4. **Flexible:** Can use quick select OR visual map based on preference

### For Inventory Management
1. **Precise Tracking:** Each cart item has exact location details
2. **Release Management:** Knows exactly which cells to pull from
3. **Stock Deduction:** Deducts from correct locations during release
4. **Audit Trail:** Full visibility of multi-location orders

### For Business
1. **Maximize Stock Utilization:** Use products from multiple locations efficiently
2. **Reduce Stockouts:** Combine partial stocks to fulfill orders
3. **Better Space Management:** Know which cells are being used
4. **Improved Accuracy:** Visual confirmation reduces picking errors

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified
1. **LocationSelectionModal.jsx**
   - Added ShelfViewModal integration
   - Added multi-select capability
   - Added auto-allocation logic
   - Added visual indicators for allocated quantities

2. **Pos_NewSale.jsx**
   - Updated `handleSelectLocation` to handle both single and array of locations
   - Added `isMultiLocationAllocation` flag to cart items
   - Maintains location tracking for each allocation

3. **ShelfViewModal.jsx** (Reused from Inventory)
   - Multi-select mode enabled
   - Auto-allocation based on cell capacity
   - Visual highlighting of selected cells
   - Real-time quantity tracking

### Data Flow
```
1. User clicks product (+) button
   â†“
2. Multiple locations detected
   â†“
3. LocationSelectionModal shows options:
   - Quick Select (single location)
   - Visual Map (multiple locations)
   â†“
4. User clicks "Visual Map" for a unit
   â†“
5. ShelfViewModal opens with:
   - multiSelect = true
   - totalQuantity = order quantity
   - highlightedProduct = product locations
   â†“
6. User clicks cells â†’ Auto-allocates quantities
   â†“
7. User clicks "Confirm Selection"
   â†“
8. Array of allocations returned to parent
   â†“
9. Each allocation added as separate cart item
   â†“
10. Cart displays all items with location details
```

## Cell Capacity Configuration

Cell capacities are defined in `StorageUnitsConfig.js`:

```javascript
{
  name: "Lumber & Wood Products",
  rows: [
    { name: "Row 1", capacity: 24, columns: 4 },  // 12 pcs per cell
    { name: "Row 2", capacity: 24, columns: 4 },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

The `capacity` value represents **maximum pieces per cell**, which the system uses for auto-allocation.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Suggested Allocation:** AI-powered recommendation for optimal cell selection
2. **Distance Optimization:** Suggest closest cells to dispatch area
3. **FIFO Logic:** Auto-select oldest stock first
4. **Batch Selection:** Select entire rows/shelves at once
5. **Mobile Optimization:** Touch-friendly cell selection on tablets

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Small Order (Single Location Sufficient)
- Order: 15 pcs plywood
- Available: Cell A1 has 24 pcs
- Action: Click Cell A1 in Quick Select â†’ Done
- Result: 1 cart item from Cell A1

### Example 2: Medium Order (Multiple Cells Needed)
- Order: 50 pcs plywood  
- Available: Cell A1 (24 pcs), Cell A2 (24 pcs), Cell A3 (10 pcs)
- Action: Open Visual Map â†’ Click A1, A2, A3 â†’ Confirm
- Result: 3 cart items:
  - A1: 24 pcs
  - A2: 24 pcs  
  - A3: 2 pcs (only 2 needed)

### Example 3: Large Order (Spanning Shelves)
- Order: 100 pcs plywood
- Available across 5 cells in different rows
- Action: Open Visual Map â†’ Click 5 cells â†’ Confirm  
- Result: 5 cart items with precise allocations

## Best Practices

1. **Always use Visual Map for orders > 50 pcs**
2. **Select cells from left to right, top to bottom** for organized picking
3. **Verify total allocated = quantity needed** before confirming
4. **Check cell capacities** to understand allocation limits
5. **Use single location when possible** for faster processing

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why can't I select a cell with the product highlighted?**  
A: The cell already has a different product or is occupied. Only empty cells can be selected for allocation.

**Q: Total allocated doesn't match my order quantity**  
A: Keep clicking cells until the allocated quantity equals your order. The confirm button is disabled until they match.

**Q: Can I change allocation after confirming?**  
A: Yes, remove items from cart and start over. Each cart item represents one cell allocation.

**Q: What if I need more than cell capacity allows?**  
A: Select multiple cells. The system will automatically distribute the quantity across them.
