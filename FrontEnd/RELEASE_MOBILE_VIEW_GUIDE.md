# Release Mobile View Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Release Management now has a mobile view similar to the Receiving Management flow. When you scan the QR code from the Release Management tab, it opens a mobile-friendly page where you can process item releases and automatically deduct inventory.

## Workflow

### 1. **In Release Management (Desktop)**
- Navigate to Inventory → Release/Outgoing tab
- Find a transaction with status "Pending Release"
- Click "Generate QR" button
- A modal appears with:
  - Transaction details
  - List of items to release
  - QR code that links to the mobile view
  - Test link for direct access

### 2. **Scan QR Code (Mobile)**
- Scan the QR code with your mobile device
- OR click the test link to open directly
- The URL format is: `/release_mobile?releaseId={transactionId}`

### 3. **Release Mobile View**
The mobile page has two main sections:

#### **Release Details Form**
- Released By: Name of person releasing items (auto-filled from current user)
- Release Date: Current date (pre-filled)
- Release Time: Current time (pre-filled)
- Notes: Optional notes about the release

#### **Products to Release**
For each product, you can:
- **Released Quantity**: Adjust the actual quantity being released
- **Product Condition**: 
  - Complete: Item is in perfect condition
  - Partial: Item is partially damaged/incomplete
  - Damaged: Item is damaged
- **Remarks**: Add specific notes about this product
- **Release Status**:
  - Released: Item will be released and inventory deducted
  - Pending: Item release is postponed
  - Cancelled: Item release is cancelled

### 4. **Submit Release**
When you click "Complete Release & Update Inventory":

1. **Validation**
   - Checks all required fields are filled
   - Ensures at least one product is marked as "Released"
   - Shows confirmation dialog

2. **Inventory Deduction**
   - For each product marked as "Released":
     - Searches for the product in inventory
     - Deducts the released quantity using Firestore transaction
     - Generates restock request if quantity falls below reorder point

3. **Status Updates**
   - Updates transaction `releaseStatus` to "released"
   - Records who released the items and when
   - Stores release details

4. **Release Log**
   - Creates a new entry in `ReleaseLogs` collection
   - Records all released products
   - Stores customer info, cashier, and total value

### 5. **Completion Page**
Shows a success screen with:
- Release summary (transaction ID, released by, customer)
- List of products with quantities deducted (shown in red)
- System updates confirmation
- Button to return to inventory

## Key Features

### Inventory Deduction Logic
```javascript
// The system:
1. Finds the product variant in inventory
2. Checks current quantity
3. Validates sufficient stock exists
4. Deducts the released quantity
5. Updates the variant quantity
6. Generates restock request if below reorder point
```

### Safety Features
- **Transaction-based updates**: Uses Firestore transactions to prevent race conditions
- **Stock validation**: Ensures sufficient inventory before deduction
- **Quantity checks**: Prevents negative inventory
- **Error handling**: Catches and reports all errors
- **Confirmation prompts**: Asks for confirmation before processing

### Restock Request Generation
Automatically creates restock requests when:
- Inventory quantity falls below reorder point
- Inventory reaches zero
- Priority set based on urgency:
  - `high`: When quantity is 0
  - `medium`: When below reorder point

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
1. **`release_mobile_view.jsx`**
   - Mobile interface for processing releases
   - Similar structure to `MobileReceive.jsx`
   - Handles inventory deduction

### Modified Files
1. **`ReleaseManagement.jsx`**
   - Updated QR code to link to mobile view
   - Changed from JSON data to URL format
   - Added test link for debugging

2. **`App.jsx`**
   - Added import for `ReleaseMobileView`
   - Added route: `/release_mobile`

## Database Collections

### Updated Collections
1. **`posTransactions`**
   - `releaseStatus`: Updated to "released"
   - `releasedAt`: Timestamp when released
   - `releasedBy`: User ID who released
   - `releasedByName`: Name of user who released
   - `releaseDetails`: Object with date, time, notes
   - `releasedProducts`: Array of released products with details

2. **`Products/{location}/categories/{category}/products/{productId}`**
   - `variants.{variantId}.quantity`: Deducted by released amount

3. **`RestockingRequests`** (Auto-generated)
   - Created when inventory falls below reorder point
   - Contains product details and requested quantity

4. **`ReleaseLogs`** (New)
   - Complete log of each release transaction
   - Includes all products, quantities, and metadata

## Testing the Feature

### Desktop Testing
1. Create a transaction in POS (it will have `releaseStatus: 'pending_release'`)
2. Go to Inventory → Release tab
3. Click "Generate QR" on a pending transaction
4. Click the "Test this link directly" to open mobile view

### Mobile Testing
1. Ensure your mobile device is on the same network
2. Scan the QR code with your mobile device
3. Fill in release details
4. Mark products as "Released"
5. Submit and verify inventory deduction

### Verification
After completing a release, verify:
- Transaction status changed to "released" in posTransactions
- Product quantities decreased in Products collection
- Release log created in ReleaseLogs collection
- Restock request created if quantity low (in RestockingRequests)

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Working
- Ensure the app is accessible from your mobile device
- Check the network connection
- Try the test link first

### Inventory Not Deducting
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify product exists in inventory
- Ensure variant IDs match
- Check Firestore permissions

### Release Not Completing
- Verify all required fields are filled
- Check at least one product is marked "Released"
- Look for error messages in console
- Verify Firestore connection
