# 📊 Reports & Logs System Guide

## Overview
The Reports & Logs system provides three essential reports to help you understand and optimize your inventory management:

---

## 1. 📈 Inventory Turnover Report

### **What It Does:**
Measures how quickly you sell and replace inventory over a specific period.

### **Formula:**
```
Inventory Turnover Rate = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory Value
```

### **Why It Matters:**
- **High Turnover (3+):** Excellent! Products sell quickly, less cash tied up
- **Good Turnover (2-3):** Healthy balance between stock and sales
- **Moderate Turnover (1-2):** Stock moves slowly, room for improvement
- **Low Turnover (<1):** Too much inventory, products not selling

### **Real-World Example:**
- You have ₱50,000 worth of cement in stock
- In one month, you sell ₱150,000 worth of cement
- Turnover Rate = 150,000 / 50,000 = 3x
- **Meaning:** You're selling your entire cement stock 3 times per month - Excellent!

### **Data Sources:**
- **Sales Data:** From POS transactions (`pos_transactions` collection)
- **Inventory Value:** From Products collection (quantity × cost price)
- **Period:** Monthly/Yearly based on filter

### **Current Features:**
✅ Monthly and yearly turnover charts
✅ Performance analysis with actionable insights
✅ Individual product turnover breakdown
✅ PDF export and printing
✅ Color-coded performance levels

## 2. 📦 Stock Movement History

### **What It Does:**
Tracks all inventory changes (increases and decreases) over time.

### **Types of Movements:**

#### **Stock IN (Additions):**
- ➕ Receiving from suppliers
- ➕ Restocking requests approved
- ➕ Manual adjustments (corrections)
- ➕ Returns from customers

#### **Stock OUT (Deductions):**
- ➖ Sales through POS
- ➖ Releases to factory/projects
- ➖ Damaged/expired items
- ➖ Manual adjustments (corrections)

### **Why It Matters:**
- Identify stock trends (seasonal patterns)
- Detect unusual activity (theft, errors)
- Plan reordering based on historical usage
- Audit trail for accountability

### **Real-World Example:**
```
Product: Portland Cement (40kg bags)

Oct 1:  Starting Stock: 100 bags
Oct 3:  +50 bags (Received from ABC Supplier)
Oct 5:  -20 bags (Sold via POS)
Oct 8:  -15 bags (Released to Construction Site A)
Oct 12: +100 bags (Received from ABC Supplier)
Oct 15: -30 bags (Sold via POS)
Oct 20: -5 bags (Damaged - marked as shrinkage)
Oct 31: Ending Stock: 180 bags

Movement Summary:
- Total IN: 150 bags
- Total OUT: 70 bags
- Net Change: +80 bags
```

### **Data Sources:**
- **Receiving Logs:** `receiving_logs` collection
- **Release Logs:** `release_logs` collection  
- **POS Sales:** `pos_transactions` collection
- **Restock Requests:** `restocking_requests` collection

### **Current Features:**
✅ Daily movement tracking
✅ Chart visualization (line/area graphs)
✅ Movement type breakdown (IN vs OUT)
✅ Product-specific movement history
✅ Export to Excel/PDF

---

## 3. 🔍 Shrinkage & Adjustment Report

### **What It Does:**
Tracks inventory losses and corrections that don't involve normal sales.

### **Types of Shrinkage:**

#### **1. Physical Shrinkage:**
- 💔 **Damaged goods** (broken cement bags, cracked pipes)
- ⏰ **Expired products** (chemicals past shelf life)
- 🌧️ **Weather damage** (water-damaged materials)
- 🐛 **Pest damage** (rodent-damaged goods)

#### **2. Theft/Losses:**
- 👤 **Shoplifting** (customer theft)
- 🚪 **Employee theft** (internal theft)
- 🚚 **Delivery losses** (missing items in shipment)

#### **3. Administrative Errors:**
- 📝 **Counting errors** (stock count corrections)
- 💻 **System errors** (data entry mistakes)
- 🔄 **Unit conversion errors** (boxes vs pieces)

#### **4. Positive Adjustments:**
- ✅ **Found stock** (discovered during inventory)
- 📦 **Bonus items** (free goods from supplier)
- 🔧 **Corrections** (fixing previous errors)

### **Why It Matters:**
- **Financial Impact:** Shrinkage directly reduces profit
- **Security:** Detect patterns that indicate theft
- **Operational Issues:** Identify handling/storage problems
- **Accuracy:** Maintain correct inventory records

### **Real-World Example:**
```
Monthly Shrinkage Report - October 2025

Product: PVC Pipes (2" x 10ft)
Starting Stock: 200 pcs
Expected Stock: 180 pcs (after 20 sales)
Actual Stock Count: 175 pcs
Shrinkage: 5 pcs (₱2,500 value)

Breakdown:
- 3 pcs: Damaged during delivery (Oct 5)
- 1 pc: Broken in storage (Oct 12)
- 1 pc: Inventory count correction (Oct 31)

Total Shrinkage Value: ₱2,500
Shrinkage Percentage: 2.5% (5/200)
```

### **Industry Benchmarks:**
- **0-2%:** Excellent inventory control
- **2-4%:** Acceptable shrinkage
- **4-6%:** Needs attention
- **6%+:** Critical - immediate action required

### **Data Sources:**
- **Inventory Counts:** Physical count vs system count
- **Damage Reports:** Manual logs of damaged items
- **Adjustments:** `inventory_adjustments` collection
- **Audit Logs:** System-tracked changes

### **To Be Implemented:**
- [ ] Shrinkage tracking by category
- [ ] Reason code selection (damaged/theft/error)
- [ ] Photo upload for damaged goods
- [ ] Monthly shrinkage percentage calculation
- [ ] Alert system for high shrinkage
- [ ] Comparison with industry benchmarks

## 🎯 How These Reports Work Together

### **Example Workflow:**

1. **Monday:** Stock Movement shows 50 cement bags received
2. **Tuesday-Sunday:** POS transactions show 40 bags sold
3. **Physical Count:** Only 8 bags remain (should be 10)
4. **Shrinkage Report:** Identifies 2 bags damaged
5. **Turnover Report:** Calculates turnover rate = 40/10 = 4x (Excellent!)

### **Decision Making:**
- **High Turnover + Low Shrinkage** = Optimal inventory management ✅
- **High Turnover + High Shrinkage** = Need better handling procedures ⚠️
- **Low Turnover + Low Shrinkage** = Overstocking issue 📦
- **Low Turnover + High Shrinkage** = Critical problems 🚨
